           <h1>What is Dosa?</h1>
           <p>Dosas are thin breads that resemble a crepe, and are commonly stuffed with a savory filling and eaten as street food or breakfast food (via Sukhi's). The batter is made from a mixture of ground rice, dal, and salt. Masala dosa is a popular type of dosa, and is distinguished by what's in its batter.</p>
           <br>
           <h1>How does it taste?</h1>
           <p>What does dosa taste like exactly? As described, it's a thin, crisp crepe or pancake. It has a slight tangy taste due to the fermentation, and is savory rather than sweet. Without the filling, on its own it's called 'plain dosa' that can be eaten with a variety of vegetable curries.</p>
           <h1>How do you eat Dosa?</h1>
           <p>How do you eat a Dosa? In fact, it's customary in the Indian culture to eat Dosa with your hands! I like to tear it off and eat it in small bites. If it's served with a dip or chutney, you can tear pieces off and dunk it into the dip or sauce before eating, or you can leave it whole and dip as you go!</p>
           <h1>Are Dosas healthy?</h1>
           <p> Dosa is a healthy breakfast option for people who need a keep a check on their fat intake. A high amount of saturated fat increases the risk of heart diseases and a number of other health problems. Dosas are low on saturated fat, which makes them a healthy and safe breakfast option.</p>
          <h1>Should I try Dosa?</h1>
          <p>You should definitly try Dosa! These delicious and crispy meals are very healthy, they are easy to make, and will be finished in no time! </p>
